Climbing out of the VR Pods, alarms sound calls to make preparation for emergency deployment to the planet's surface. **1st Lt. Kim** is currently in command while the captain and ambassador are planetside for a conference. "VS forces are pushing into the capital city and firefights are breaking out in the streets." Kim addresses the crew via ship-wide announcement "Cressidium is not a **UNION** planet. **Captain Farris** and **Ambassador Bannerjees'** safe return is our primary objective. **Bayonet protocol** is still in effect, do not engage unless fired upon. Let's bring our people home."
