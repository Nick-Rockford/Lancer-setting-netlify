## Staff Sergeant Omari Garcia (He/Him)
It takes a special breed of person to be a marine lifer, and Staff Sergeant Omari Garcia is a marine’s marine. He’s tough, he’s stubborn, he’s fearless, and he proudly plays his part in the long-standing traditional sibling rivalry between Union marines and their naval mech pilot counterparts, always ready with a joke or a crack about “fancy suits” whenever a mech pilot starts getting a little too full of themselves (marine pilots are themselves only occasionally exempt from this). He is, however, fiercely loyal to everyone aboard his ship, and given the chance he’ll be the first one into danger and the last one out of it. 

A recipient of the Marine Distinguished Service Medal for his actions during the Pellaran Dispute, SSgt. Garcia has been wounded many times in the course of action and has seen his share of dead comrades, but although he often talks about retiring one day to somewhere tropical he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. On those rare occasions he takes shore leave planetside he enjoys fishing, and he has an avid interest in antique firearms.
