## Captian Brigid Farris (She/Her)
Captain Farris is a career naval officer, having served for 20 years subjective, 10 of those as captain of the Rio Grande after her promotion from executive officer aboard the cruiser Reykjavík. In that time, she’s proven herself to be a confident and capable commander whose quick thinking and level-headedness under pressure has earned her the respect of her crew.

Despite being temporally distanced from her homeworld by the time-dilating effects of extended nearlight travel, Farris enjoys telling stories of her old life working at her family’s bakery, and impromptu baking contests culminating in shared meals have become something of a tradition during shore leave.

Under Farris’s command, the Rio Grande has seen occasional combat duties on her long interstellar patrols – primarily anti-piracy actions (notably against the infamous Dead Suns pirate clan) as well as joint operations with a Department of Justice and Human Rights task force during the liberation of Corazón. This is Farris’s first recontact mission and it’s one she’s eager to see succeed peacefully and amicably for all involved. Cressidium lacks any major naval powers, so it’s unlikely the Rio Grande will be called upon to participate in combat even if things should turn sour, but she isn’t so overconfident as to forego regular shipboard readiness drills.
