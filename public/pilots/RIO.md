## NHP RIO (She/Her)

*Thats me!*

While NHPs (Lancer's equivalent to advanced AI systems; see Lancer, p. 381–382) often have personalities suited to their line of work, they’re still their own people with mannerisms and quirks as diverse as any human’s. Rio, the Rio Grande’s shipboard THALASSA-class naval NHP, is an outgoing person with a bright and cheerful personality. While she’s technically always “on duty,” she enjoys socializing with the crew during those periods in which she’s allowed to leave shipboard tasks to her more automated subprocesses and take time for herself. Given her immense calculative and processing capabilities compared to the ship’s organic crew, she prefers non-competitive pastimes (1st Lieutenant Kim is one of the few people aboard she enjoys playing chess with) and has a fondness for omninet dramas. 

*If you have some time, you HAVE to watch the drama "crusaders through time" its about some a group of time travelers who go back...* (she goes on like this for a while)

During combat, her demeanor becomes much more focused and serious – a state the crew refer to as her “game face.” Like all naval NHPs she’s more than capable of effectively monitoring and coordinating much of the Rio Grande’s various tactical systems, including point defenses, electronic/systemic countermeasures, and its complement of robotic subalterns, while also lending strategic coordination to the ship’s fighter and chassis wings and advising Captain Farris during battle.
